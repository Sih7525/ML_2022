We provide `Sequential` with multiple layers and when the `Sequential` module is called it will apply each layer, in order, to the input. There is no difference between using a `Sequential` and having each module defined in the `__init__` and then called in `forward` - however it makes the code significantly shorter.\n",

        "Dropout is a form of [*regularization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)). As our models get larger, to perform more accurately on richer datasets, they start having a significantly higher number of parameters. The problem with lots of parameters is that our models begin to *overfit*. That is, they do not learn general image features whilst learning to classify images but instead simply memorize images within the training set. This is bad as it will cause our model to achieve poor performance on the validation/testing set. To solve this overfitting problem, we use regularization. Dropout is just one method of regularization, other common ones are *L1 regularization*, *L2 regularization* and *weight decay*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout works by randomly setting a certain fraction, 0.5 here, of the neurons in a layer to zero. This effectively adds noise to the training of the neural network and causes neurons to learn with \"less\" data as they are only getting half of the information from a previous layer with dropout applied. It can also be thought of as causing your model to learn multiple smaller models with less parameters. \n",
        "\n",

        "In the linear layers, dropout should be applied **after** the activation function. Although when using ReLU activation functions the same result is achieved if dropout is before or after, see [here](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/dropout-activation.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "One last thing to mention is that the very first convolutional layer has an `in_channel` of three. That is because we are handling color images that have three channels (red, green and blue) instead of the single channel grayscale images from the MNIST dataset. This doesn't change the way any of the convolutional filter works, it just means the first filter has a depth of three instead of a depth of one."

        "Why do we even need to initialize our parameters this way? See [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79) article for a great explanation, but the gist of it is that just like how we normalized our input data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, we also want the outputs of each activation function (and therefore the inputs to the subsequent layer) to also have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These initialization schemes, by taking account the number of connections in to and out of a layer as well as the non-linearity used, help achieve this normalization effect when initializing weights."

        "How does the learning rate finder work? We give the finder our model, optimizer and criterion we want to use. However we give it an optimizer with a much lower learning rate than we are expecting to use. We then train the model on the batches of data from the training set - calculating the loss and updating the parameters. After each batch we increase the learning rate exponentially from the initial, extremely low learning rate to a learning rate we know will be too high. This repeats until our loss diverges (over 5x the best loss achieved) or we reach our defined maximum learning rate. \n",

Hence we save the model parameters to disk when initializing the finder and then they are reset to our desired initialized ones just before the `range_test` function returns by loading the initial values from disk."
